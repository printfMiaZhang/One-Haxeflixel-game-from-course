# One-Haxeflixel-game-from-course

Concept:

This is just really normal shooting enemy idea. I personally think it is not so clever. It can be appealed to the viable market because of the challenge of rising lava, shooting the enemy, and prevent touching from the enemies this three reasons at the same time. I think it is okay to let this game become serious because the player needs to pay attention to the HP and can’t let HP become zero or the controlled character will die. 

Game rule:

1.The player need to press space key to start the game.
 
2. The player should use up and down key to control the direction.
3. Use left and right key to fire the bullets
4. The player should pay attention to the level of the lava. And if the player does not control anymore, and doesn’t aware of rising lava, the character in the game will die.
5. The player should pay attention to the level of the lava. And if the player does not control anymore, and doesn’t aware of rising lava, the character in the game will die.
6. The HP of the character will be decreased by accidentally being touched by the small skull.
7. The score will be increased by hitting the small skull.
